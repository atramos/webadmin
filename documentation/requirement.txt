Project Description:
I need the attached script (webadmin.php) modified to support security on a per-file basis:

When a user first opens webadmin.php, they must be shown a Login or Register Wall. To register, they must provide an Email, Password, and Justification. Email addresses must be confirmed via encrypted link with confirmation code (same used by many websites) sent to the user and to the site owner. Both the user and the owner must click on their respective links in order to approve the registration.

Newly registered users must have the ability to see the directories (list files) but not see or modify any files.

Users then must request read/and/or/write access to the files they want to see, one by one. They must be able to do this by clicking the web interface (inside of webadmin.php).

Once a request for access is created by the user, an email must be sent to the site owner to approve it. The site owner can they approve or deny the request by clicking links in the email. The end-user must be notified of the approval disposition.

Everything must be done inside of webadmin.php. You cannot require the user to go through other places (except their email) to accomplish the functions described.

DESIGN: I want to keep everything in one file (webadmin.php). If you need to persist some data, you must use a MySQL database and a webadmin.ini for the configuration. The site owner's email address must also be configured inside of webadmin.ini. You have to make webadmin.ini, it doesn't exist right now.

This project is urgent. Deadline will be strictly enforced. Please bid wisely.
